Create/modify nextflow.config:

Must be in the directory the pipeline is launched from. Bind mounts must be provided in “runOptions” for the database/s directory, as well as any other directories involved in the command (apart from the working directory). Memory overrides are important to ensure resources for the computationally demanding processes. 

Load modules:

module load nextflow
module load apptainer

This will load the apptainer/1.3.1 and nextflow/24.10.1 defaults. 

Example command:

nextflow run ahrd_singularity.nf -with-apptainer AHRD.sif --chunksize 500 --threads_per_process 4 --total_threads 200 --input_fasta pissa.Cameor.gnm1.ann1.7SZR.protein_primary.faa --outdir pissa_test --databases databases.csv --gaf /reference/data/Uniprot/2025-07-07/goa_uniprot_all.gaf.gz

Arguments:
	
--input_fasta (required)
The proteins to analyze; the .faa extension is not required, though diamond will exit with an error message if a nucleotide file is provided.

--databases (required)
3 column .csv file including database name, full path to database, and diamond index file, respectively. Any number of desired databases >= 1 is acceptable, though the names must match one of the following strings: uniref90, swissprot, trembl, medtr_lis, glyma_refseq
Uncompressed and gzipped .fasta files are both acceptable.

--gaf (required for GO terms)

--chunksize <500>
	number of records (- 1) each “chunk” of the input_fasta will include. 

--total_threads <128>
	
--threads_per_process <4>
	total_threads / threads_per_process will equal the processes created, not accounting for the controller.

--outdir <working directory>
	Directory name for output folder. Relative path is acceptable.

Notes:

•	The pipeline may be restarted with progress retained after alignment and/or interproscan processes have completed on all .fasta “chunks” and been concatenated, as well as when the ahrd_config.yml is generated.

•	Because the pipeline will not overwrite these files (or the .fasta chunks), a new out_dir should be provided for different runs (when the ‘resume’ functionality is not required/desired), or the contents of the out_dir deleted prior. There is a warning message to this effect when reusing an existing out_dir.

•	The work directory “work” persists as a general nextflow feature. It is advised to delete this periodically in the absence of special cause to retain it. 

•	As a reference datum, an input of ~89k Pisum sativum proteins completes in ~11 hours with total_threads = 400 and threads_per_process = 4. Completion time will vary with queue load.
